== Frequently Asked Questions ==

I installed the plugin but can’t see it. What’s wrong?
Make sure the directory name is entered correctly on the settings page.

Where to upload my image?
wp-content/plugins/tozz-slideshow/Slideshow/
also you can chage the location via widget configuration.

How to upload my image?
Via Ftp or Filezilla or cute ftp or  any other file transfer protocol.

Widget title appears but no photos appear below it?
Make sure the directory name is entered correctly on the settings page. this is the default photo location wp-content/plugins/tozz-slideshow/Slideshow/

Why my image gallery out of range?
In front end widget area, if you see gallery out of area or invisible, it because of height and width of the widget, so you should arrange width and height of the widget in widget configuration area. In default I have fixed width: 200px and height: 155px.

Why my slideshow not scroll properly or why one image overlaps another at the time of scroll?
Set the scrollerwidth and scrollerheight to the width/height of the LARGEST image in your slideshow!
